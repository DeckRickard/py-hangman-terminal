# Python Hangman Terminal Game
This was created as part of the Computer Science Career path on CodeCademy.

I luckily had already created a hangman prototype in Python in the past, so I could use that as a basis for this project. However, I decided to make the game able to played singleplayer, against the computer, or with multiple human players. This allowed me to use classes to define player parameters. I also had an interesting challenge in defining only one function for the main game logic, with different functions for initialising single or multi-player games which pass different arguments in to the main game function. I also decided to use an external file to store the word bank, which allowed me to practice interacting with files using Python.
